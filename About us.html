        <p>This website is the continuously evolving effort of many people from many
disciplines within the Yale School of Art and its wider circles. It is a <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a>, meaning that every graduate student, staff person, and 
faculty member of the School can change this website&#8217;s content or add to it at any time. (Logins for other friends, alums, and members of the school are coming soon.)</p>
<p>When you click &#8220;Edit this page&#8221; on any page, you&#8217;ll be prompted to log in using your Yale ID. Then you can proceed to make changes or additions to that page, which everyone else will see.</p>
<p>For practical reasons, not everyone in or associated with the  School has access to edit every part of every page.   For example,  
while students may offer their views on a course&#8217;s page, or add information or resources, they cannot create official course descriptions. (At the moment, locked areas and content types are the exception rather than the rule.)</p>
<p>That said, we, as a collaborative community, are confident that  the information on
this website is as reliable as that on any website and more open  to diverse voices and perspectives than most.  In order that it  
remains so the site&#8217;s interactivity is to be used freely but  widely. As you move through it you may, in consequence of such openness,  encounter content that surprises you or with which you  don&#8217;t agree. That will be the sign that this website reflects life  
in our institution in all its heterogeneous dimensions.</p>
<h3>Some questions or concerns</h3>
<p>When you have questions about the appropriateness or the  functioning of
this website, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:art.help@yale.edu">art.help@yale.edu</a>. We&#8217;d appreciate hearing from you.</p>
<h3>More about this site</h3>
<p>The graphic templates and inner workings of this site were  designed and
programmed by Tamara Maletic and Dan Michaelson of the graphic design
partnership Linked by Air; together with Takashi Okamoto of  MudCorp. Dan
is on the faculty here.</p>
<p>The site is unusual for being a module-based wiki. Authors choose a module
appropriate to the content they&#8217;re contributing, such as a calendar, an
image gallery, a list, an official course description, or general text.
Each module then applies intelligence to gather and format its  content in
a colorful and systemic way. Authors combine several modules in  sequence
to form a complete page.</p>
<p>The site is programmed using Ruby on Rails.</p>
