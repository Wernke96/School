        <p>Yale College, the undergraduate division of Yale University, offers a Bachelor of Arts
degree program with a major in art. Undergraduate applicants wishing to major in art
at Yale must apply to Yale College directly. Please contact the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, PO Box 208234, 38 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven CT 06520-8234,<br>
        </p>
        
    <p>The program in art offers courses that, through work in a variety of media, provide an experience in the visual arts as part of a liberal education as well as preparation for graduate study and professional work. Courses at the 100 level stress the fundamental aspects of visual formulation and articulation. Courses numbered 200 through 499 offer increasingly intensive study leading to greater specialization in one or more of the visual
disciplines such as graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.</p>
        <p>Please do not pre-register for studio art courses in which the permission of the instructor is required. Students MUST attend the very first class meeting, in most cases, to be considered for admission to a given class, as art courses are often over-subscribed, especially at the introductory level. Space is limited, and faculty make selections based on individual criteria after course cards are filled out.
        </p>
        <p>For graduation as an art major, a total of fourteen 14 course credits in the major field is required. These fourteen course credits must include the following: (1) five prerequisite courses at the 100 level (including Visual Thinking and Basic Drawing); (2) four 200-level and above courses; (3) the Junior Major Seminar (Art 395a) or Critical Theory in the Studio (Art 201b); (4) the Senior Project (Art 495 and 496); and (5) two courses in the History of Art. Suggested program guidelines and specific requirements for the various areas of concentration are available from the director of undergraduate studies. A suggested program guideline is as follows:</p>
