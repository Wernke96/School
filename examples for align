  <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
  <p>Under the first heading, we have some text in a paragraph tag.</p>
  <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
  <p align="right">This is a second paragraph. It is aligned to the right.</p>
  <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
  <p align="center">Another paragraph. This one is centered.</p>
  <h3 align="center">Heading Level 3 - centered</h3>
  <p>Even though all the text in this paragraph is in the same tag in XHTML code, 
     there is a line break directly after this sentence.<br>
	   This is accomplished using the line break command. Always be sure to close
	   your line break tag. This isn't your old-school sloppy HTML code!</p>
  <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
