			<h2 id="materials">Admission Materials</h2>
			
			<p><strong>1.</strong> The online application and the nonrefundable application fee of $100. Please follow payment instructions at <a href="https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/">https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/</a>. Forms of payment include
			credit card and checking account.</p>
			<p>Online applications can be worked on from September 1 until the deadline. As it generally takes several weeks to complete an application, it is strongly recommended that applicants prepare their materials early to ensure completion by the deadline.</p>
			<p>Please note that the School of Art is NOT part of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and it is not possible to apply by using application materials found on the Graduate School&#8217;s Web site. <strong>It is recommended that you read the online School of Art bulletin</strong>, available at <a href="http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/art.pdf">http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/art.pdf</a>, before beginning the application process.</p>
			<p><strong>2.</strong> A one-page statement that addresses your inﬂuences, interests, current work direction, brief life history, and reasons for applying to a graduate program at this time. Statements should be no more than 500 words and should make reference to the representative work in your portfolio.</p>
			<p><strong>3.</strong> References from three persons practicing or teaching in the field in which application is made, attesting to the applicant’s ability and competence in that field.</p>
			<p>NOTE: <em>Because the admissions committee reviews applications shortly after the deadline, time limitations may preclude reading any supporting documents uploaded after the deadline. Please impress this fact on the people who will be writing on your behalf.</em></p>
			<p><strong>4.</strong> Transcripts of the academic record for the bachelor&#8217;s degree and/or transcripts from professional art schools attended. Student copies or unofficial transcripts of the academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or transcripts from professional art schools attended are uploaded for the preliminary jury. Official transcripts will ONLY be required for applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.</p>
			<p><strong>5.</strong> Portfolio of work. <strong>Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined in this bulletin by the stated deadline will not be considered.</strong> The portfolio should represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction, and demonstrate your ability. At least half of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months, and all should be from within the last three years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you will not be able to override it. One image from the portfolio should be designated as a “representative work.” This selection will be printed for the application file as the piece you feel most strongly represents ideas central to your current body of work. Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed other pages of a publication or video within the images you place in your portfolio. Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstances should more than two detail shots be included. Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of concentration; be sure to follow the instructions for the area to which you are applying. We strongly recommend that you review your images on a Mac OS to be certain that they are accurately represented.</p>
			<p>NOTE: <em>All supporting documents that are submitted as a requirement for admission become a part of the official file and cannot be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution either in copy or original form.</em></p>

			<h2 id="graphic">Graphic Design Portfolio Requirements</h2>
			<p>In addition to a portfolio, all graphic design applicants should upload a résumé, which will be reviewed for content as well as form of the typography; the résumé may not be longer than three (3) pages.</p>
			<p><em>File format</em></p>
			<p>Portfolios are submitted online as part of the online application. The portfolio submission interface will allow you to label each image with a title, a date of completion, the materials used, and a brief description of the work. Please do not embed your name in the titles of your work and limit titles to thirty (30) characters. Digital files must adhere strictly to the specifications outlined below.</p>
			<p><em>Portfolio contents</em></p>
			<p>Upload a total of twenty (20) still images and/or moving image files. A significant number of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months. Three-dimensional works should show the surrounding space and context. Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstance should more than two detail shots be included. If you are presenting both still and moving images, please present them in two groups with all still images followed by all moving images. Within these groups, place all still and/or moving image files in chronological order starting with the oldest and ending with the most recent work. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you will not be able to override it.</p>
			<p><em>File format for still images</em></p>
			<p>To conform to our viewing format, each still image file may be no larger than 16 MB. Do not format images in any presentation program (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote), or include composite images (more than one work per file). Still image files may be sent in jpeg, png, bmp, or tiff format.</p>
			<p><em>File format for videos and moving images</em></p>
			<p>Videos will be accepted in QuickTime (preferred), AVI, FLV, MP4, or WMV format. Video files should be no longer than two minutes in length, and the size of your video uploads is limited to 64 MB. If you upload a video that is longer than two minutes, it will automatically time out at two minutes. Please note that videos are considered as part of your selection of twenty files and should not be used as a method of showing examples of additional still images. Do not include titles or credits within the video files.</p>
			<p>If you are primarily a video artist and wish to submit a longer video, you may post the video to your own Web site and provide the link at the end of your statement.</p>

Only work completed within the last three years should be included, and at least half (8) should be work made in the last twelve months.

Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstance should more than two detail shots be included.
